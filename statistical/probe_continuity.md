# Probe Continuity Test

Probe continuity test confirms  proper  electrical  and  insulation  properties  within  the  pulse oximeter  probe. When the probe is being tested, the cabling should be gently wiggled as a stress test to check for intermittent
abnormal electrical connections.  This is useful for intermittent problems, isolating the problems and ruling out human error.
