# Probe Continuity Test

Probe continuity test confirms  proper  electrical  and  insulation  properties  within  the  pulse oximeter  probe. When the probe is being tested, the cabling should be gently wiggled as a stress test to check for intermittent
abnormal electrical connections.  This is useful for intermittent problems, isolating the problems and ruling out human error.

Ideally, this test will be programmed in to the device firmware and run every time after turn-on (taking 3-5 seconds).
